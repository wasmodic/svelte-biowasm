# Wasm version of EMBL-EBI's Muscle service

This is a SvelteKit-based web application that provides a WebAssembly (Wasm) version of the Muscle multiple sequence alignment tool. The application allows users to perform sequence alignments directly in their web browsers without the need for server-side processing.

You can find the live application here: https://blog.wytamma.com/embl-ebi-muscle-wasm 

# Development video 

I recorded a video of the development process, which you can watch here: [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwoTI0WhznQ). It's pretty ruff (i did zero prep), but it might be interesting to see how I approached building this application.

# Deployment video

I also recorded a video of the deployment process, which you can watch here: [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvXMMXdpiBg). This video covers how I set up the GitHub Actions workflow to automate the build and deployment of the application.
