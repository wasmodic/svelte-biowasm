# Wasm version of EMBL-EBI's Muscle service

This is a SvelteKit-based web application that provides a WebAssembly (Wasm) version of the Muscle multiple sequence alignment tool. The application allows users to perform sequence alignments directly in their web browsers without the need for server-side processing.
